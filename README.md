A testing project carried out by my teammates and me (thanks to Fredi and Yuval) during our software testing course.

We applied various testing techniques, executed test cases on two versions of the software we received, documented the results, and reported defects.

During the process, we prepared an:

-	**STP** (Software Test Plan).

-	**STD** (Software Test Design).

-	**STR** (Test Summary Report).

-	**Bug Report**.

All the files are available in the attached link to Google Sheets:

The requirement, specification, and design documents, as well as the two software versions we tested, were not uploaded to here because they belong to 'John Bryce' college.
